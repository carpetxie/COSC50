# Initialize lab2 as a git repository. What command did you use for that?
git init

# Make sure that README.md is tracked. What command did you use for that?
git add README.md

# How would you go about cloning the lab2 repo on your local machine? What command would you use for that?

I would go onto my local Downloads directory and then secure copy via scp to the ssh:

scp fa25jeffrey@plink.cs.dartmouth.edu/lab2 .
